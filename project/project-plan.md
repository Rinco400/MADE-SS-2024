## Topic: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Environmental Regulations on Water Safety

## Main Question
How effective are environmental regulations in managing the safety of groundwater sources, as reflected in changes to radioactivity levels?

## Summary:
This project aims to assess the impact of environmental regulations on groundwater safety, particularly focusing on the changes in radioactivity levels in natural mineral water. With climate change influencing water resources, understanding the effectiveness of policy measures is crucial for ensuring safe and sustainable water supplies. The project will analyze historical data on groundwater levels and radioactivity to investigate whether regulatory interventions have led to significant changes in water quality.

## Goal:
The main goal of this research is to determine the effectiveness of environmental regulations in managing the safety and quality of groundwater resources. By conducting a detailed comparative analysis of radioactivity levels in groundwater before and after the implementation of key environmental policies, the study aims to:(Upcoming)
