## Topic:  Analysis of Radioactivity in Baby Food and Natural Mineral Water Quality

## Main Question
1. How do the levels of radioactivity in baby food compare with the quality parameters of natural mineral water in Hamburg, and what are the potential correlations and implications for public health and environmental quality?

## Summary:
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of radioactivity levels in baby food ("Babynahrung Gemüse und Hühnchen mit Nudeln") and compare these findings with the quality parameters of natural mineral water within the Hamburg region. By investigating trends over time and across different locations within Hamburg, the study seeks to uncover potential correlations and provide insights into the factors influencing both food and water quality. The findings will contribute to understanding environmental quality and public health implications, guiding future measures for quality management in Hamburg.

## Goal:
The primary goal of this project, "Comparative Analysis of Radioactivity in Baby Food and Natural Mineral Water Quality," is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the levels of radioactivity in baby food and compare these findings with the quality parameters of natural mineral water in the Hamburg region. This study aims to assess the safety and quality of these essential consumables, identify temporal and spatial trends, and determine if there are significant correlations between the radioactivity in baby food and the quality of natural mineral water. By investigating these aspects, the project seeks to provide insights into the environmental quality and public health implications, ultimately guiding future measures for quality management in Hamburg. The findings will offer detailed recommendations for ensuring the safety and quality of food and water, contributing to better public health outcomes.
